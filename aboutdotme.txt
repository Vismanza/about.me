You know how you always see these out of shape guys in the gym (you do go right?) pushing stupid weights and looking below average in terms of physique?

The typical comment from them when they notice your concern is something along the lines of “I’m in a bulking phase bra.”.

Well that’s what is happening here. I am still learning how to get the best out of the myriad of tools out there (including the hosting & configuration of this site).

My current work in progress is to map out the current layout and lay that against my goals. This will then be a map of making sure I keep relevant with what I document. My goal is to make this my personal body of knowledge.

To that end, “I am in a bulking phase bra.”.

As the about me text changes I will be tracking in a GitHub repo because why not? Also, at some point in the distant future I think it will be fun to review the changes over time.

Current thinking: My blog will be organised into three main categories based on feeding. Feed the mind, body and geek. :-)
