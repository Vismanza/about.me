You know how you always see these out of shape guys in the gym (you do go right?) pushing stupid weights and looking below average in terms of physique?

The typical comment from them when they notice your concern is something along the lines of “I’m in a bulking phase bra.”.

Well that’s what is happening here. I am still learning how to get the best of these online tools (wordpress type stuffs) but don’t want to hold off generating content.

To that end, “I am in a bulking phase bra.”.

As the about me text changes I will be tracking in a GitHub repo because why not? Also, at some point in the distant future I think it will be fun to review the changes over time.

Here is the link to the GitHub file: https://github.com/Vismanza/about.me/blob/master/aboutdotme.txt
